### AI RPG

## Project Overview
This project was created as a test of how well AI could write a source code for a game. The `AI_original_rpg.py` was created completely by ChatGPT and Claude, being stitched together by humans. The `AI_edited_rpg.py` has some human edits that attempt to patch some issues and bugs.

## The game features:
1. **Character Creation**: Classes like "warrior," "mage," and "rogue," each with unique attributes (health, strength, agility, and magic).
2. **Items and Inventory**: Items like health potions and magic scrolls, affecting health or magic abilities.
3. **Quests and Story Progression**: Trackable quests, with choices and progress influencing the storyline.
4. **Main Game Loop**: Includes a continuous loop for gameplay and story progression.
